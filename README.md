cornerStone - PHP Version
==========

My personal framework/workflow using Bourbon, HTML5 Boilerplate and Grunt.

Updates:

* Reworked cornerStone for PHP.  Utilizes TweenMax.js, waypoints.js, animate.css as well as some basic @fontface

Install Instructions:

* Make sure you have both Grunt (grunt-cli) and Node.js installed, along with SASS of course.
* In the command line of your project directory, type: npm install.
* Load up your site on localhost (MAMP/WAMP) and type 'grunt dev' for development and 'grunt' for production.

Enjoy!
